# CNN Project: Dog Breed Classifier

## Deep Learning Nanodegree Udacity (with Pytorch)

### Project Overview

In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.
If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

The project includes:

- Creating a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
- Creating a CNN Using Transfer Learning
